                Started with creative pursuits in Class 8 - graphic design,
                video editing, and YouTube content creation. The JEE journey
                taught me resilience, even when chemistry didn't go as planned.

                Experimented with multiple businesses - from book reselling to
                dropshipping, learning hard lessons about markets and logistics.
                Each "failure" was actually a stepping stone to understanding
                business and technology better.

                Now at LNMIIT, I'm combining technical skills with

                AI/ML and Web3.
